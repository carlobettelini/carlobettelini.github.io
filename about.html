        <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">My name is Carlo Bettelini. I was born in 1994, I am 1,9 meters (74,8 inch), so that makes me pretty tall. I am very creative, and I like making short films in my spare time, as well as some video games. Those who know me well know that I am thoughtful,
            collaborative, and determined.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">Since when I was a kid I started getting invested in creating short videos, and in primary school I produced my first serious works. When I was in highscool in 2013 I won the second place at Tagliacorto with

        </div>
        <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">After that I managed to enter <a href="http://www.cisaonline.ch " target="_blank ">CISA</a>, a training institute in the field of cinema, television and multimedia culture. I had many chances to develop short videos, and even after I finished
            it, I continued to collaborate with them in many occasions. You can see most of my works I did after that period in the
            <a href="./videomaker.html ">videomaker</a> section.</p>

        </div>
        <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">After three years of continuous production and collaborations, I decided to start a bachelor in Computer Science at
            <a href="https://www.usi.ch/it" target="_blank ">USI</a>, as it is a sector that is evergrowing in importance. I still don't have much to show about my endeavours as a programmer, but I'm always producing something and still collecting all
            of my works, so with a bit of patience, I'll have more to offer to you in the <a href="./programs.html ">programs</a> section.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">I apologize for the lack of professionality in the way I show you my works, my products are scattered all around the web, it 's been a fun work researching everything, and first or later I'll collect everything in one place.</p>
